## Your first task

Now that you have [ubyssey.ca](https://www.ubyssey.ca) set up on your computer, you're ready to start on your first task!

Most of our tasks and projects are documented in GitHub issues on the [ubyssey.ca](https://github.com/ubyssey/ubyssey.ca) repo. This helps us keep track of who is working on what, keeps everything documented, and allows for more open communication between team members.

### Joining our organization

Before you can start claiming issues, you'll have to create a GitHub account and join our [organization](https://github.com/ubyssey). Once you have an account, send me (Peter) your username on Slack (or email) and I'll add you to the org!

### Choosing an issue

Issues can be found by visiting the [issues page](https://github.com/ubyssey/ubyssey.ca/issues) of the repo, where they can be filtered by type (frontend, backend, design) and difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced). Each issue also has a point value, which indicates the amount of work required and also determines the [compensation](/compensation.md) for that task.

Issues that are already claimed will show an assignee on the right side of the page.

After you find a task that interests you, feel free to assign it to yourself. This tells the rest of the team that you'll be working on that task. If you have any questions about the task, don't hesitate to post a comment on the issue or ask on Slack.

**If you aren't sure how to approach a task, feel free to claim it anyways. You can always come to office hours for help getting started.**

### I'm ready!

For this tutorial, we'll be walking you through the process of claiming an issue, writing some code, and then submitting that issue for approval. 

To start, find the **Getting Started Tutorial** issue on the issues page. Normally you would assign it to yourself, but since you won't be the only one completing this tutorial, simply leave a comment that says something like "I'd like to work on this."

Once you've read over the requirements, move onto the next section!
