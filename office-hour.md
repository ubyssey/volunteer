## Volunteer Office Hours

Office hour meetings for 2020-2021 will take place at 11AM - 12:30PM Tuesday and Thursdays.

These meetings are a chance to get everybody in the same room to chat about assignments, ongoing projects, and to allow the web developer or anybody else to answer questions about technical problems.

### Slack

We do all of our communication via [Slack](https://slack.com/)! Web volunteers will be available to answer any questions as they arise. To get the invite to `#web-volunteers` channel send an email with your full name to our web developers at [Contact Us](https://www.ubyssey.ca/contact/)!
