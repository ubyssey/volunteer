## Volunteer Office Hours

Weekly office hours will be held on **Thursday from 12:30 - 14:00 in The Ubyssey office (2018 Winter Term)**, unless otherwise specified.

These meetings are a chance to get everybody in the same room to chat about assignments, ongoing projects, and to allow the web developer or anybody else to answer questions about technical problems.

### Slack

We do all of our communication via [Slack](https://slack.com/)! Web volunteers will be available to answer any questions as they arise. To get the invite to `#web-volunteers` channel send an email with your full name to `atsushi@ubyssey.ca`.
