# Forking GitHub Repositories

According to GitHub's [Official Forking Tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), "A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project."

In git, forks are philosophically different from branches in that branches keep changes out of the project's main branch _temporarily_ as they are worked on, until it is time to merge. Forks, meanwhile, are _new_ projects, which will not necessarily continue to have anything to do with the original project. While it may be possible to merge changes in a fork back to the original project, forks, unlike branches, are not created with the intention of doing so. [(see this stackexchange discussion for the fork-branch distinction)](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/237433/git-branch-or-fork#:~:text=In%20git%2C%20branch%20is%20a,out%20of%20the%20main%20project)

It may be useful, for example, to fork the [example development tools](https://github.com/ubyssey/ubyssey-dev) we provide to your own github account so you can version control the configuration settings you like to use when programming for the site.

In this tutorial, you will fork the [ubyssey.ca project](https://github.com/ubyssey/ubyssey.ca)

First go to [our ubyssey.ca repo](https://github.com/ubyssey/ubyssey.ca), and find the "Fork" button on the right

Next if you're in multiple organizations, select your own GitHub profile.

After selecting where to fork to, GitHub will start copying the files over

After this is done, you shold see a new copy of ubyssey.ca repo under your username!

When you clone the project, be sure to clone from your own forked repo (ex. <YOUR-USERNAME>/ubyssey.ca )
