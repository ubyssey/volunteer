# Forking GitHub Repositories

According to GitHub's [Official Forking Tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/), "A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project."

A great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Make the fix.
3. Submit a pull request to the project owner.

In this tutorial, you will fork [ubyssey.ca project](https://github.com/ubyssey/ubyssey.ca)

First go to [our ubyssey.ca repo](https://github.com/ubyssey/ubyssey.ca), and find the "Fork" button on the right
