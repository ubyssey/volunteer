# Installation

As a first step, create a GitHub account and clone our repositories:

Before you can start writing code, set up your local development environment. Docker is commonly-used virtualization software that will let you _automatically_ set up a development environment with all the necessary dependencies isolated from the rest of your system.

* [**Docker (automatic) instructions**](/installation/docker.md) <!-- (**Recommened**) -->

Instructions for post-installation

<!-- * [**Running the server**](/installation/running-the-server.md) -->
* [**Wagtail setup and development**](/installation/wagtail-setup.md)
<!-- * [**Dispatch Setup**](/installation/dispatch-setup.md) -->
## Testing Setup

After setting up your development environment if you want to add test cases and run them across multiple browsers you can refer to the tutorial below.
