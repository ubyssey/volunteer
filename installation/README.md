# Installation

As a first step, create a GitHub account and clone our repositores:

* [**Forking GitHub Repository**](/installation/forking-the-repo.md)

Before you can start writing code, set up your local development environment. Docker is commonly-used virtualization software that will let you _automatically_ set up a development environment with all the necessary dependencies isolated from the rest of your system.

* [**Docker (automatic) instructions**](/installation/docker.md) (**Recommened**)
