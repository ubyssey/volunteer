# Our Technology {#our-technology}

We use a variety of languages, tools and frameworks at _The Ubyssey_. We try our best to stay up to date with new and emerging software, as well as current trends and best-practices. Above all else, we strive to produce products that are stable, well-tested and easy to work with.

#### _The Ubyssey_ does open source! {#the-ubyssey-does-open-source}

_The Ubyssey_ is committed \(no pun intended\) to open source development, which means all of our code is available on GitHub and we always welcome pull requests. We made the decision to open our codebase to foster a stronger development community at our paper, and also to promote collaboration with other student papers in Canada and abroad.

#### Slack

We do all of our communication via [Slack](https://slack.com/)! To get the invite to `#web-volunteers` channel send an email with your full name to `atsushi@ubyssey.ca`!

### Dispatch {#dispatch}

[Dispatch](https://github.com/ubyssey/dispatch) is our custom-built publishing platform that powers [ubyssey.ca](https://www.ubyssey.ca/). It was created as a replacement for WordPress and was built with flexibility and ease-of-use in mind. Developed as an open-source project, Dispatch aims to provide a set of tools that make it easier for journalists to produce high-quality digital content. We've been using it in production for two years, and it's almost at a stable \(1.0\) release.

### Chatbot {#chatbot}

Our newest project aims to deliver the news in a new way. We plan to build a chat bot app using Facebook's Messenger API that will send information about campus news to students in a fun, conversational way. The project will be a combination of web development and machine learning, with lots of room for experimentation!
