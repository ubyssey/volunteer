Since 1918, _The Ubyssey_ has been produced entirely by student staff and volunteers, a group that has included writers, editors, photographers, videographers and illustrators. _The Ubyssey_ boasts such alumni as Prime Minister John Turner, author and journalist Pierre Berton, as well as many journalists now working at publications such as _The New York Times_, _The Globe and Mail_ and _The Toronto Star_.

In recent years, our team has grown to include software developers and designers who help build and maintain new features for our website, work on editorial projects and experiment with new ways of delivering the news. Our digital team has been responsible for numerous national journalism awards over the years, including the John H. MacDonald award for Best Website.

If you are a developer who is looking for more experience, or even if you're new to web development, we'd love to have you join our team!
