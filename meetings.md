## Volunteer Meetings

Weekly meetings will be held on **Thursday from 12:30 - 14:00 in The Ubyssey office (2018 Winter Term)**, unless otherwise specified.

These meetings are a chance to get everybody in the same room to chat about assignments, ongoing projects, and to allow the web developer or anybody else to answer questions about technical problems.
