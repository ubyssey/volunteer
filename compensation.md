## Volunteer Compensation

Starting this year, _The Ubyssey_ will provide monetary compensation to volunteers who produce consistent, high-quality work.

Web tasks are identified as issues on GitHub. Each issue is given a point rating from 1-5, where a higher rating indicates a more challenging or time-consuming task. 

When a volunteer closes an issue, they then claim the points for that issue. At the end of every month, the web developer will sum the points that each volunteer has earned during that month.

Each point will be worth $10 CAD. Therefore, if a volunteer accumulates 5 points for the month, they will receive a cheque for $50 CAD.

**To be eligible for compensation, volunteers must:**

1. Regularly attend weekly meetings
2. Complete at least 3 tasks
